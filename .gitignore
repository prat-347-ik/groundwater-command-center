# --- Service B: Model Versioning & Artifacts ---

# 1. IGNORE Heavy Binary Artifacts
# We only want to store the code and the registry, not the 500MB model files.
models/v1/artifacts/*.pkl
models/v1/*.pth
*.pth

# 2. IGNORE Transient/Temp Run Files
# These are overwritten every run and don't need history.
models/v1/evaluation_summary.json
models/v1/latest_run_manifest.json

# 3. FORCE INCLUDE Registry & Metadata (The "Registry-as-Code" Pattern)
# We use '!' to ensure these are tracked even if a parent folder is ignored.
!models/v1/model_registry.json
!models/v1/metadata/*.json
!models/v1/explainability_report.md

# 4. IGNORE Archive (Optional)
# If you don't want to track retired models in Git history to save space.
models/v1/archive/

# 5. IGNORE pytest cache files
